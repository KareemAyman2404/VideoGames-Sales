Hello Hello, a videogamer just like me? well this is a good chance to have a look about some videogames Data over the past years!!

First Step: Cleaned the Data using Pandas to make sure that the Data is ready to get into the Action.
Second Step: Doing some analysis using MySQL to know more info about the Data before getting it into the show.
Third Step: Visualizing Data using Microsoft Power BI that you will find the .pbix file in the repository.

This is still my first project using Pandas so hope you enjoy my baby steps into the world of Data cleaning using Python.
